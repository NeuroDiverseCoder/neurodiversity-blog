      <description>Weird.
This is the only public place where I feel comfortable sharing these personal thoughts&amp;hellip;
I recently accepted that I have ADHD. More than that tho, I now understand what Neurodiversity means. It explains so much about me&amp;hellip;
It is weird&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip; but I feel happy?
Now, I do know that I need to figure out how to manage this neuro divergence so I can better interact with other neuro beings.</description>
