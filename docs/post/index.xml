      <description>Weird.
This is the only public place where I feel comfortable sharing these personal thoughts&amp;hellip;
I recently accepted that I have ADHD. More than that tho, I now understand what Neurodiversity means. It explains so much about me&amp;hellip;.
It is weird
&amp;hellip;but I feel happy?
Now,
I do know that I need to figure out how to manage this neuro divergence so I can better interact with other neuro beings.</description>

      <description>Finally watched a talk on #Neurodiversity for the first time.
At some lvl, I knew I was neuro diverse and I guess I was afraid of getting confirmation?
After hearing what @SlickBricker had to say about it, it helps me understand really well certain things in my life.
here the video that did it for me: https://youtu.be/4tJBTCBbqrM </description>
