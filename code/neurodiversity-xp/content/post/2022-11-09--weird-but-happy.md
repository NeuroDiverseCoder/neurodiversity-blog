Weird.  

This is the only public place where I feel comfortable sharing these personal thoughts...  
 
I recently accepted that I have ADHD. More than that tho, I now understand what Neurodiversity means. 
It explains so much about me...

It is weird...
... but I feel happy?


Now, I do know that I need to figure out how to manage this neuro divergence so I can better interact with other neuro beings.

After fighting a log of self stigma... I have a therapist session booked!
