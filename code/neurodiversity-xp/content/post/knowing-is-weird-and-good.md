Weird.

This is the only public place where I feel comfortable sharing these personal thoughts...

I recently accepted that I have ADHD. More than that tho, I now understand what Neurodiversity means. It explains so much about me.... 

It is weird  
...but I feel happy?

Now,  
 I do know that I need to figure out how to manage this neuro divergence so I can better interact with other neuro beings.

So, after fighting a lot of stigma... 
...I have a therapist session booked!
