# Neuro Divsersity Experience
Hello and welcome my fellow diverse and beautiful humans!  
- perhaps you are a robot? in which case...
- welcome all the same! You beuatiful set of wonderfully arranged bites!

Currently, we only have one initiative/project.  
That is a website where we host blog posts with contents from people that want to share their experience with Neuro Diversity:
- https://www.neurodiversity-xp.net/
- and to make it shorter, also at https://www.ndxp.net/

## Projects
### NDXP.net
This is a blog where people can share their experiences about neuro diversity.
If you would like to write a blog post, we would love to help you share your experience!
- see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
